Version 0.3.3 (September 1, 2015)
-----------------------------
  * Yaroslav Klyuyev <https://github.com/imposeren> made some improvements
  to the code regarding Django templates and i18n. See the pull request 
  on github: https://github.com/wreckage/django-happenings/pull/16


Version 0.3.1 (August 25, 2015)
-----------------------------

  * Yaroslav Klyuyev <https://github.com/imposeren> suggested using django
  templates to build calendar cells. Some reverse incompatible changes were
  introduced: please read "Update from 0.2 to 0.3" section in README.
  New "features":

    * Default django setting "TIME_FORMAT" is used by default. Custom values for
    CALENDAR_TIME_FORMAT must be changed to new notation

    * popover contents in data-content are properly escaped. Previously it was
    possible to break layout by using ``"`` (double quotation marks) in
    description or locations

    * i18n is used for all parts of calendar (no translations provided)

    * calendar style maybe customized just by overriding templates: no subclassing
    is needed anymore



Version 0.2.6 (July 13, 2015)
-----------------------------

  * Bob Bowles <https://github.com/BobBowles> suggested using an empty
    string as the default locale (which means the system locale will be
    used) instead of en_US in utils/display.py. Seems like a good idea
    so I made the change. Also updated readme to emphasize that the
    locale can be specified via CALENDAR_LOCALE setting in settings.py.


Version 0.2.5 (June 22, 2015)
-----------------------------

  * added 'current_happenings' template tag to display events that are
    happening now.
  * created a template partial called happening_events.html for the new tag.
    It resembles upcoming_events.html.
  * added .is_happening(now) function in models, so that you can call
    event.is_happening(now) to see if the event is happening 'now' (where
    'now' is an optional datetime, and by default is right now)
  * added tests for the new 'current_happenings' tag, but I was getting
    a strange invocation error when I tried to put the tests into their
    own file, so I stuck the tests in with upcoming_events tests.


Version 0.2.4 (May 03, 2015)
-----------------------------

  * Tomek Główka <github.com/tttomekkk> added a django18 test environment,
    adjusted some tests, and cleared the way for Django 1.8 support.
